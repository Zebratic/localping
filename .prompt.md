Create me a tool that can be run in the terminal as "localping".

This program should ping the gateway (10.0.0.1 for my system, but you need to get it automated), and cloudflare (1.1.1.1) or other DNS providers.

It should be able to ping anything, using ICMP, TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, and be able to notify me if there is any issues on my system. It should show desktop notifications and also have a GUI that visually shows statistics over my home lab 
services.

So stuff like monitoring my TrueNAS, Jellyfin, qBittorrent and many other selfhostable solutions on my proxmox server. So i want a nicely integrated program that can be ran on any linux desktop. (for me, i run on KDE plasma on arch linux).

The GUI should be able to show me graphs, and historic uptime. and other alerts. including quick access to run pre-saved commands on the server such as SSH and run command on remote server, run scripts, send HTTP requests, or do other actions. 
Like a "Quick fix" type of button i can preconfigure for a uptime monitor.

i also want some kind of command i can put in my .zshrc which renders a small compact UI in my terminal when i open it. (i use kitty terminal)

Programming language is your choice. please research properly to understand my requirements, and then code up a prototype of this program.


As a bonus, i would also like to have a web UI interface where we can also view the uptime statistics. split the website into 2 things, and admin view (showing buttons and edit, and another webserver site (on a different port) to show a public 
facing uptime monitor, that is in read only mode.
